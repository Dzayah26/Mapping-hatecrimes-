    <!-- STORY -->
  <p>  In 2020 there nearly 62% of hate crimes reported in the United States were of racial bias, while 20% of hate crimes reported were of sexual orientation bias.

In the city of New York, there were 72 hate crimes reported in 2020 that were racially or sexually biased. In 2021 reports of hate crimes with similar biases jumped by 28 new reports, bringing the total reports between the two years to 172 hate crimes reported. With the highest reports of hate crimes coming from two different precincts in Manhattan and Staten Island. Both precinct 10 in Manhattan and 120 in Staten Island had a report of 10 hate crimes that were racially or sexually biased. Precinct 10 covers Hell’s Kitchen, Chlesea and the Hudson yards, all neighborhoods that have a high LGBTQ+ population. Precinct 120 covers the North Shore, this is where the Staten Island Ferry drops off, making this a high traffic area for crime to happen.

 Though this number is significantly low, there’s still some explanation as to why these numbers are high during the pandemic. [Expert quote goes here]
